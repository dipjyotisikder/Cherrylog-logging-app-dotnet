Cherrylog : How to use this application!

1. Make sure you have .net5 runtime installed.<br />
2. Install seq from this https://datalust.co/seq website.<br />
3. Set port of your seq http://localhost:5321 during installation. <br />
4. Run application. See logs in Logs/log.txt file or in Seq.<br />

Thats it!<br />
For more info on seq please visit https://docs.datalust.co/docs/getting-started here.<br />

Why all this?<br />
I have provided a simple api by which anyone can test how's everything working inside serilog and seq.<br />
 
Thank you.
